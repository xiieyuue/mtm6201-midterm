                    At Flora, our story began with a boy's hope. Our founder, Alice, grew up in a small village in the countryside, surrounded by fields of wildflowers. As a child, he dreamed of sharing the beauty of these flowers with the world.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Years later, Alice moved to the city and began working in the floral industry. But he always felt that something was missing. He wanted to create a flower shop that was more than just a place to buy flowers. He wanted to create a space that was infused with the same hope and beauty that he felt as a child.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And so, Flora was born. From our humble beginnings as a small shop in the city, we've grown into a community of passionate flower lovers who are dedicated to sharing the beauty of flowers with the world.
